# CapstoneProjectFall2019
Computation app.

Feature ideas:

- Natural language processing
- Equation parsing and graphing
- maybe 3d graphs if we have time
- Algorithm for solving algebra and producing accurate solfing steps (Maybe...)




Project structure plan:

- Server/Computation language: Python 3


To discuss:

- Are we going to use a framework for the frontend? If so, which one?
